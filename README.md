# TeensyGuitarHero

Teensy program for MIDIfication of a Gibson Guitar Hero controller augmented with a MMA845X accelerometer.
The controller has been hacked by GaÃ«l Jaton.
It also features a Teensy audio board extension and an additional jack plug that directly allows embedded audio synthesis.
See `archive` folder for original code on which the program is based.
The actual MIDI controller program does not implement any audio synthesis.
